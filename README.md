# Quaro Quadruped Robots
Planning- and control-software for Quadrupedal Robots.

The software ensures a safe and stable walking gait. However, there are some issues with the robot's body like weak servos and mechanics. That's why a new bigger version is currently under development, that hopefully can exhaust all possibilities.
