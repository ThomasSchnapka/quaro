# Quaro Quadruped Robot v3
Planning- and control-software for Quadrupedal Robots.

This is the third iteration of my quadruped robot. As it is still in development, some files in this repository are still missing and some pictures are are out of date. However my goal is to upload all new files as soon as possible!

The robot uses a Raspberry Pi for control and an Arduino Mega 2560 for handling the hardware.

Here are a picture and a video of the old version, which already had a quite stable gait.
